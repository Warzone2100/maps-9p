The map is overpopulated by Scavengers with more or less good weapons. They also have a lot of ranged weapons. Some areas (at the edges) are a bit less well-defended, while others (in the center and corners) are much better protected. Be sure to watch out for sensor towers and -vehicles!

So don't get too close to the Scavs! Luckily, there's only one entrance to your base. Keep the Scavengers at bay, for example, with ranged weapons. But be careful, they also have CB and and wide-spectrum sensor towers (in the center and corners).
